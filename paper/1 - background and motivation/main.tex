\section{Background and Motivation}
    In its base relase, the gyrokinetic code {\tt GENE} has support for only Maxwellian backgrounds
    \begin{align}
        f_{s0}(\bfx; \bfv)  &=  f_{s0}^{\rm Max}(\psi; v_{\parallel}, \mu)  \\
        &=  n_{s}\sqrt{\frac{m_{s}}{2\pi k_{B}T_{s}}}^{3}\exp\left[- \frac{1}{k_{B}T_{s}}\left(\frac{m_{s}}{2}v_{\parallel}^{2} + B\mu\right)\right]
    \end{align}
    in species $s$, where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  $v_{\parallel} =$ the parallel velocity
        \item  $\mu = \left(\frac{m_{s}v_{\perp}^{2}}{2B}\right) =$ the magnetic moment
    \end{itemize}
    $\psi$ is constant along flux tubes (using the notation as used in \cite{Abe+13}) and the following are functions of $\psi$ only, such that they are constant on flux tubes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  $n_{s}(\psi) =$ the particle density
        \item  $T_{s}(\psi) =$ the temperature
    \end{itemize}

    In reality, the space of background distributions for tokamak plasmas is much more rich than just Maxwellians, and different background distributions can have great effects on the behaviour of the model.
